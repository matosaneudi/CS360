Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements of the app were to have user authentication, to have a database to store user info like log in and passwords. A databse to store items and their quantities and to be able to edi those items and their quantities.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I created several screens to support the users needs. I created one screen for the user to log in and sign up, one to ask the user for SMS notification permission, one to display items and quatities. And the last screen was a dialog screen to add items. My designs while simple i feel they were effective because they were minimilistic and intuitive. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I struggled staying focused on the creation of this application because i found it dificult at times, I started to use the pomodoro method late into the term and i wish I would of started using that strategy sooner. It is something that i will apply to all of my future projects. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Although my application was not perfect at the end and still had performance issues and difficulty displaying items in the recylcer view, it revealed that i have a lot to work on in terms of my skills and studying. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
As previosly mentioned I needed to improve my process of studying, research and staying foucused on problem solving. I innovated my process by finding different ways to stay focused and try to learn as much as possible.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Even though I felt it was the easier part of the project i enjoyed using the android studio to design a UI for the application. Also learning about color selection and design.
